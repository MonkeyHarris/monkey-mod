Win32 version installation
==========================
Create a "comp" directory and unzip the Monkey Mod ZIP into it (except for
"geoip.dll" - see below). Copy your "server.cfg", "maps.lst" and "teammaps.lst"
files from the "main" directory into the "comp" directory. Set the mod options
and server defaults in the "comp.ini" file.

To start the server:
	kingpin.exe +set dedicated 1 +set game comp +exec server.cfg

Or if you use the kpded.exe executable:
	kpded.exe +set game comp +exec server.cfg


Linux version installation
==========================
Backup your "main/gamei386.so" file so that you can get back to the original
game if you wish to.

Unzip the Monkey Mod ZIP into your kingpin directory. Set the mod options
and server defaults in the "main/comp.ini" file.

To start the server:
	nohup ./kpded +exec server.cfg &


*** IMPORTANT *** : Make sure you take the time to setup the "comp.ini" options
correctly for the type of server that you wish to run.


GeoIP setup
===========
Monkey Mod can display what country players connect from, using the MaxMind GeoIP
library and database.

On Windows, the "geoip.dll" library (included in the Monkey Mod ZIP) and "geoip.dat"
database should be placed in your kingpin directory.

The latest GeoLite Country database (geoip.dat) can be downloaded from here:
	http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/

On Linux, the GeoIP library and database can be installed from the distro's
repositories.

If you wish to disable country lookups, you can simply remove the GeoIP library
and/or database.
