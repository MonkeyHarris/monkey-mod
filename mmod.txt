Installation
============
Unzip the Monkey Mod package into your Kingpin directory and edit the config
files (eg. server.cfg and comp.ini) in the mmod directory as you want. Then
start the server. Using the enhanced kpded2 server software is recommended,
and is requred for some Monkey Mod features (see the changelog below).

To start a Windows server:
	kpded2.exe +set game mmod +exec server.cfg

To start a Linux server:
	nohup ./kpded2 +set game mmod +exec server.cfg &

Or if you would prefer to use the original Kingpin executable:
	kingpin.exe +set dedicated 1 +set game mmod +exec server.cfg

The "mmod" directory can be renamed to something else, in which case the
"game" setting in the server command line should also be changed.


GeoIP setup
===========
Monkey Mod can display what country players connect from, using the MaxMind
GeoIP library and database.

On Windows, the geoip.dll library and geoip.dat database should be in your
Kingpin directory. The latest GeoLite Country database (geoip.dat) can be
downloaded from here:

	http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/

On Linux, the GeoIP library and database can be installed from the distro's
repositories.

If you wish to disable country lookups, you can enable the "disable_geoip"
option in comp.ini, or remove the GeoIP library and/or database.


Changes from monkey cds 1.53 to monkey mod 2.0
==============================================
 * kpded2 should be used to run Monkey Mod for many enhancements including...
   - players can download map vote pics (and sounds and skies) that they don't already have
     from the server
   - the team of each player is shown in server browsers such as Qtracker and GSpyLite
   - other players are notified when a player cancels connecting
   - lagged out players that reconnect before they've timed out can continue from where they
     left off
   - banned players are told that they're banned when refused connection
   - some other benefits are mentioned below

 * anti-lag system (based on the "Unlagged" Q3 mod)
   - compensates for client latency (eg. ping) when shooting (movement is unaffected) to
     allow a player to aim directly at the other players instead of ahead of them, by
     checking where the other players were when the trigger was pulled.
   - controlled by a new "antilag" cvar: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled (default)
   - the latency reduction is limited to around 500ms. For example, if a player has a
     ping of 600ms then their effective ping can only be reduced to around 100ms
   - only applies to bullets and pipe/crowbar (not rockets/grenades/flames)
   - rockets are handled differently: they are fast-forwarded a bit at launch according to
     how much over 100ms the delay between the player pressing fire and the rocket being
     launched is. There is no fast-forwarding effect if the delay is under 100ms.
   - players can use "antilag 0" in the console (or "set antilag 0" in autoexec.cfg) to
     disable the anti-lag system on their shots

 * rocketmode
   - enabled by setting the "dm_realmode" cvar to 2
   - the only weapon is the bazooka; all weapon/mod pickups are removed from the map and
     all ammo is changed to rockets
   - splash damage is reduced to 50% on others and only 10% on self to encourage rocket jumping
   - reload delay is removed

 * bonuses for killing players with more frags in deathmatch (teamplay 0)
   - a new "bonus" cvar (and "default_bonus" comp.ini option) can be set to a frag deficit that
     will result in receiving a bonus hit, 0 = disabled (default). When a player is killed with
     at least this many more frags and a higher frags per minute ratio, the killer will receive
     a bonus hit (+2 instead of +1). Bonuses are only received after playing for 1 minute.

 * automatic spectating for lagged out players
   - players become spectators if their connection goes dead for 5 seconds; they can rejoin the
     game if/when the connection recovers
   - lagged out players are shown in grey in the spectators scoreboard

 * map list/rotation tweaks
   - "custom_map_file" comp.ini option is renamed to "maps_list" ("custom_map_file" is also accepted
     for back-compatibility) and a "bm_maps_list" option is added for a separate bagman maps list
   - if a map list isn't specified in comp.ini, the "g_mapcycle_file" cvar will be used (if set)
   - rank is no longer used (old map lists including rank are still accepted for back-compatibility)
   - the list is pre-checked and any non-existing maps are removed from it
   - the list also provides the map rotation (maps.lst/teammaps.lst are no longer used)
   - if the current map isn't in the rotation then the first map (or random map if "default_random_map"
     is enabled) will be next

 * props support
   - the "props" cvar can be used to enable props in maps: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled except rats/fish,
     2 = enabled including rats/fish
   - reduced number of entities used by exploding bodies and crates
   - fix for exploding fire extinguisher prop crash

 * support for rain and snow clouds

 * locational armour usage/damage without dm_locational_damage enabled
   - head/body/leg armour is used depending on height of hit
   - head armour is used when hit by dropping platforms/doors

 * when a player is telefragged it doesn't affect their score

 * random spawn point selection will skip any occupied points

 * players will spawn next to a spawn point if there are no free spawn points (to avoid telefragging)

 * team spawn points are also used in standard deathmatch when playing a bagman map

 * neutral spawn points close to a safe are changed to team spawn points

 * fix for badly positioned spawn points
   - spawn points partially in a wall/floor/ceiling are moved a bit away from it
   - spawn points further inside a wall are removed
 
 * fix to stop spawning within another player

 * fix to stop $30 reward being given even when killing enemy away from safe in small bagman maps
 
 * fix to make splash damage blood drops come from the player instead of the wall

 * fix for r_cullaliasmodel error messages when a player picks up a cashbag while they have
   anti-spawncamp protection active

 * HMG cooler mod replaced with rapid fire pistol mod in realmode

 * each team/model combination now has a single skin set (instead of 2) in team play
   - the most distinctive (most red or yellow) skin set is always used
   - spectators are also given a team skin to avoid unnecessary skin/model loading

 * current team indicator to remind anyone that forgets what team they're on
   - the top-right corner of the screen is coloured appropriately (kpded2 is needed to download the images)

 * "start in X seconds" countdown messages are replaced by audio cues (beeps)

 * chase tweaks
   - the closest player will be chosen as the target when starting chasing
   - eyecam view is now exactly the same as the target player sees, including bobbing/recoil/flames/etc
   - the target's body/shadow is removed in eyecam mode (so it never appears in view) when kpded2 is used
   - fix to no longer chase the target when they become a spectator
   - fix to prevent camera movement by the chaser in locked chase modes

 * standard deathmatch spectator tweaks
   - scoreboard "time" value doesn't include time spent spectating
   - other players are notified when a player becomes a spectator
   - spectators stay as spectators after map changes
   - the "spec" command does nothing when the player is already a spectator
   - the team change overflow protection also applies to spectating & rejoining

 * scoreboard tweaks
   - name of current map shown at top of scoreboard
   - accuracy column added to bagman scoreboard

   - current map is excluded from vote options
   - fixed a bug that excluded the first map in the map list from the vote options
   - fix for "GL_MAXTEXTURES" error (related to map vote pics)

 * map change voting
   - when used by a non-admin, the "changemap" command will start a vote to approve the map change

   - players will change to attack stance when shooting while jumping

 * a new "toggle_zoom" command to toggle FOV zooming-in ("no_zoom" cvar)

 * individual flag setting with "setdmflags" command
   - '+' value prefix sets a flag, '-' prefix unsets a flag
 
 * a new "toggle_bunny" command to simplify enabling/disabling bunny-hopping
   - automatically calculates the appropriate "dmflags" value

 * "fixed_gametype" comp.ini option no longer blocks the use of the "setdmflags" command

 * "changemap" command can load any map on the server if "fixed_gametype" isn't enabled
   - players will also remain on the same teams if the game type isn't changing

 * rconx "status" and admin "clientlist" command tweaks
   - now includes players that are connecting
   - a "lastmsg" column is added that shows how long ago the client was last in contact
     with the server

 * "players" command enhanced to look like the rconx "status" command but with the player's
   country shown instead of their IP address

 * other console command tweaks
   - "commands" command only lists commands that the player currently has access to
   - "settings" command includes anti-spawncamp/bunny-hopping/shadows/zooming in its list
   - "publicsetup" command removed ("resetserver" can be used instead)
   - "listdicks" admin/rcon/rconx command renamed to "listbans"
   - logged-in rconx users can use the "admin" command without a password to take admin

   - spectating disabling only affects match mode, not public mode
   - chasing is also disabled when spectating is disabled
   - can now be enabled by elected admins via "toggle_spec" command
   - disabled spectators won't receive any player movement info when kpded2 is used

 * waiting for players in a low power idle mode
   - enabled by the "wait_for_players" option in comp.ini
   - saves CPU and disk activity on idle servers (more CPU is saved with kpded2)
   - if map voting is enabled, the first players can choose which map to start playing on

 * serverinfo trimmed down

     (the "settings" command can still be used to check them)
   - "time remaining" cvar renamed to "time", "team scores" renamed to "scores", "team
     names" renamed to "teams"
   - "cashlimit" only included for bagman

   - "default_anti_spawncamp" comp.ini option added
   - "disable_asc" option removed (wasn't working as described anyway)

 * "default" settings are now optional
   - any setting that doesn't have a "default" entry in comp.ini will be left as it is when
     the server is reset

 * "maxrate" option removed
   - the server never sends more than 15000 bytes/second anyway (usually a lot less) except
     during downloading (which was unaffected by "maxrate")
   - a warning is shown in the MOTD screen when the player has "rate" set below 15000

 * timescale kicking removed
   - kpded2 has its own better timescale kicking option
   - speed cheating is still effectively disabled via the "sv_enforcetime" cvar setting

     install.txt for more info)
   - the country info is also shown in the "players" list

 * any cash held by a player will be dropped when they disconnect or spec

 * added a new cvar (no_zoom)
   - no_zoom disables zooming-in by setting the FOV below 90

 * source files available on github: https://github.com/MonkeyHarris/monkey-mod


Changes from monkey cds 1.52a to monkey cds 1.52b
=================================================
 * changed every instance of "monkeymod.com" to "poisonville.net/mm"


Changes from monkey cds 1.52 to monkey cds 1.52a
================================================
 * few small bug fixes


Changes from monkey cds 1.51a to monkey cds 1.52
================================================
  * func_killbox fix
   - killbox was using TELEFRAG_MOD so when someone was killed with it no death message got 
     printed, so this was changed to use TRIGGER_HURT_MOD

 * cash thief exploit fix
   - now if a person steals money from the other team and jump over the edge or into lava the
     money automatically gets returned into the teams safe.

 * bagman spawning fixed
   - completelly rewriten the spawn selection code so now you will only ever spawn in your
     teams spawn points, not in opposition or info_player_start

 * mute command
   - with it you can mute players (stop them from chatting). This will only work until map 
     change. To unmute the client just mute them again. Note clientid can be seen by using the
     rcon/rconx status command.

     Usage: mute clientid

 * kick and kickban reason
   - rconx users can kick and kickban people now with an optional reason message, just incase
     the people who are getting kicked or kickbanned want to know why
     
     Usage: rconx kick(ban) <clientid> <reason>

 * banip and banname usable from rcon now
   - using the sv command, banip and banname can be both used
  
     Usage example (from game): rcon password sv banip 192.168.0.1
                                rcon password sv banname Loser
                (from console): sv banip 192.168.0.1
                                sv banname Loser
 
 * eyecam bug fixed
   - fixed a problem where the spectators would have the same score in game browsers like
     GameSpy and All Seeing Eye as the people they were following. This fixes that problem.

 * misc cheat fixes


Changes from monkey cds 1.51 to monkey cds 1.51a
================================================
 * small bug fix
   - there was a conflict with some of the code which made people use gl_polyblend hack
     without getting kicked, now this is fixed. 

 * timeouts
   - decreased the chance of timeouts by optmizing the server side check code and also
     by making the server check you several times (not just once) before it marks you 
     as timed out. Also timeout time increased to 20 seconds.


Changes from monkey cds 1.50c to monkey cds 1.51
================================================
 * clan tag detection by Snap
   - added code that will detect your clans tag and change the team name on the scoreboard
     to that clan tag. The clan tags will also be displayed in GameSpy cvars as "team names".
     For this feature to work the server needs to be in MatchMode and there needs to be at
     least 2 players on each team that have at least 75% of matched tags.


Changes from monkey cds 1.50b to monkey cds 1.50c
=================================================
 * changed the spectating disabling command for admins
   - now admins should use toggle_spec instead of disable_spec

 * added a new cvar (no_shadows)
   - no_shadows removes the player shadows if set to 1 or lets the
     clients decide (via gl_shadows) if set to 0
   - no_shadows is 0 (off) by default, set it to 1 (on) for it to take effect
   - no_shadows can be set from server console, rcon/rconx and server.cfg
   - admins can use toggle_shadows command to change it

 * spectator modes change
   - order of specator modes has changes, now eyecam is first followed by 
     locked mode then the freelook mode

 * matchstart change
   - on matchstart all entites droped in the map will be taken out and all the entities
     that have been picked up will be respawned

 * new rconx commands
   - added banip, banname commands to rconx clients
   - with banip and banname the ip address or the name of the client you wish to ban
     will be written to ip ban list file and name ban list file specified in comp.ini
   - bans take effect on next map change
   - please use these 2 commands cautiously as the process is only reversable manually
   - you can ban names with partial match so be careful what words or part of words you ban
   - also with banip you can also ban subnets (read ips.txt for more info)
     also be extremly careful with this too

 * chat fix
   - fixed a bug where rconx normal chat looked like team chat

 * team deathmatch fix
   - now if a bagman map is loaded in team deathmatch mode there will be no safebags,
     no cash spawns and no cash dropping.

 * no footsteps fix
   - fixed a problem where players could misuse a command to make their footsteps silent


Changes from monkey cds 1.50a to monkey cds 1.50b
=================================================
 * added new cvar (no_spec)
   - no_spec makes the screen black for non-admin/non-rconx spectators (basically
     stops them from seeing whats going on in the server). This is to stop voice 
     communication cheating by using programs such as Roger Wilco and BattleCom 
     to give away the players positions and details
   - no_spec is 0 (off) by default, set it to 1 (on) for it to take effect
   - no_spec can be set from server console, rcon/rconx and server.cfg
   - admins can use disable_spec command to change it
   - note when this is enabled if people have gl_polyblend set to 0 they will
     get kicked for a flamehack because gl_polyblend set to 0 will remove the
     black spectator screen

 * removed kick_flamehack from comp.ini
   - now kick_flamehack can only be set in server.cfg or by a command

 * modified idle_client cvar
   - now it will only boot players to spectator mode if a match is in progress,
     not during pre-match, map voting or intermission time.
   - increased default time to 120 seconds

 * fixed team joining problem
   - fixed the team joining problem during Pre-Match countdown

 * chat change
   - made the admin team talk have round brackets around the name
     instead of pipes like in normal admin talk


Changes from monkey cds 1.50 to monkey cds 1.50a

 * taunting as spectator bug fixed

 * clearme command removed (didn't see any use in it)

 * polyblend command removed
   - now you can set gl_polyblend to 2 to get the polyblending effect

     and retrieved on rejoin 
 
 * enabled anti_spawncamp in real mode

   - admin/rconx normal chat is printed to all clients as yellow
     (can still team talk)

 * prints who <Name Clash> is trying to immitate

 * added new cvar (idle_client)
   - idle_client can be set to a number of seconds a client can be idle
     for before being turned into a spectator (60 seconds is minimum/default)
   - idle_client can be set from server console, rcon/rconx and server.cfg
   - password admins can you setidletime command to change it

 * fixed realmode deathmatch score bug
   - now you don't get 2 deaths each time you die
   - fixed the scoreboard so it shows hits and time not hits and score

 * enabled spectator team chat in deathmatch mode


Changes from monkey cds 1.40d to monkey cds 1.50
================================================
 * added 2 new cvars to server

   - anti_spawncamp (made it so you are invincible for 3 seconds on each spawn (anti-spawn camp))
     * when you spawn your weapon will flash 3 times indicating the 3 seconds of immortality
     * option in comp.ini to disable this feature (disable_asc)
     * admins have a command called toggle_asc to toggle this on/off
     * rcon/x users can just toggle the cvar from console
     * this can be set in the server.cfg as well

   - kick_flamehack (kick clients with hacked flames)
     * option in comp.ini to turn this feature on 
     * rcon/x users can just toggle the cvar from console
     * this can be set in the server.cfg as well
     * from now on you'll get kicked for using gl_polyblend set to 0 
       (because it removes the flame from screen). Some people use this only to get rid off
       those annoying flashes when you pick things up etc. All those people should use
       a new command "polyblend" which will remove these flashes but not flames.

 * improved the kick message when clients don't have mmclient.exe or have an old one 
   or have invalid models or old version of kingpin.exe (it shuts kingpin.exe down and a popup 
   window gives them the kick message and what to do about it)

 * fixed admin status on map change (used to just made proper admins into elected admins on map 
   change)

 * made it so eyecam is the default specatator mode

 * name change is printed in screen and server console

 * option in comp.ini to have unlimited curse (every 7 seconds)
   (so you don't have to face a player to curse)

  - if you have rconx you can type: rconx cds on/off
  - if you are the server admin you can type directly into console: sv cds on/off
